# Manifest Interview App

A cafe point-of-sale system. Products, orders, and a checkout flow are already
built — you'll extend and build on top of it during the interview.

## Preparing for the interview

Please fork and clone this repo and get the app running locally with the steps below.

Install [bun](https://bun.com/) (Node.js-compatible runtime) and dependencies, and start a development server:

```bash
# Install bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
# Install dependencies
bun install
# Dev server
bun dev
```

Make sure you can access the app at [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/).

Finally, install [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

We'll provide you with Claude API keys at the start of the interview. You may use a different tool (e.g., Cursor, Codex) using your own subscription if you prefer.

Feel free to explore the repo beforehand. The stack is intentionally light. You're welcome to add
libraries (a component library, an ORM, etc.) before or during the interview to make yourself more
productive. We naturally expect you to cut corners in an interview that you wouldn't cut in
production.

## Stack overview

- **Runtime:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) — server, bundler, and package manager in one
- **Database:** SQLite via Bun's built-in [SQL client](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/sql) (tagged template literals)
- **API:** [ts-rest](https://ts-rest.com) — type-safe contracts shared between server and client, with Zod validation
- **Frontend:** React 19, Tailwind CSS, React Query (auto-generated hooks from ts-rest contracts)

## Adding a feature end-to-end

The products and orders features are complete working examples. To add a new resource, follow the same pattern:

1. **DB Schema** — update `src/server/schema.sql` as needed
   - Optionally add seed data in `src/server/seed.ts`
   - The server detects changes to either file and drops and recreates all tables with fresh seed data. No db migrations.
2. **Contract** — define routes and Zod schemas under `src/shared/contracts/`, then register it in `src/shared/contract.ts`
3. **Handlers** — implement the contract in a new file under `src/server/api/`, then register it in `src/server/api/index.ts`
4. **Page** — add a React component in `src/client/pages/`, then register it in `src/client/pages/index.tsx`

API responses are validated against the Zod contracts at runtime, so schema mismatches surface immediately.
